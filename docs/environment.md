To run the mobile app with hot module reloading on android device emulator, run:

    \Foo\Bar\MonorepoRootFolder> yarn run start:android

## Scripts
Following scripts are executed for every sub repository via lerna.
Be aware that these commands require [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) as a global dependency.
Due to limitations of the react-native the `src/mobile-app` package is not yet integrated as a yarn workspace
and has no lerna management support in this project.

To install install `node_modules` in every package, run:

    lerna bootstrap

To remove `node_modules` from all packages (mobile-app excluded), run:

    lerna clean

To run all package tests (mobile-app excluded), run:

    yarn run test

To type check every package, run:

    yarn run tsc

To test linting for every package, run:

    yarn run lint

To fix linting for every package, run:

    yarn run lint:fix

To execute tests, type check, lint fix and build every package, run:

    yarn run ci
